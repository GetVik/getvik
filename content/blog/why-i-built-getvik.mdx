## India needed this.

Creators here don’t have a local, simple, low-fee platform to sell digital products.  
Everyone was trying to force Razorpay pages, PayPal, or complex setups that don’t feel built for solo creators.

I kept seeing:

- High international fees  
- Delayed payouts  
- Random compliance blocks  
- No tools for selling files  
- Platforms treating India like an afterthought  

So I built **GetVik**.

A platform that is:

- **INR-native**  
- **UPI-first**  
- **Creator-friendly**  
- **Simple enough for beginners**  
- **Strong enough for pros**  

## What problem am I actually solving?

Creators want one thing:

**Make money easily.**

Not set up a full-stack business.
Not fight with gateways.
Not debug JSON errors on a Saturday night.

They want:

- Upload digital product  
- Add price  
- Share link  
- Get paid  
- Withdraw earnings  

That’s it. This is the core I focused on.

## The real unlock → UPI

UPI is India’s superpower.  
It makes buying digital products frictionless.

Scan. Pay. Done.

Creators shouldn’t be forced into card payments or international processors.

## What GetVik will become

A place where an Indian creator can:

- Sell files  
- Sell templates  
- Sell e-books  
- Sell code  
- Sell videos  
- Sell anything digital  

And get paid on time.

This is what I’m building publicly.  
This is the start.
