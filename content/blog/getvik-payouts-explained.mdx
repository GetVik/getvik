## When someone buys your product…

The moment a buyer completes payment — UPI or card — everything fires instantly:

- The order is created  
- Your earnings balance updates  
- Your digital file is delivered  

No loading bars. No “awaiting approval.”  
Just instant movement.

## The platform fee part (don’t worry, it’s simple)

Before the earnings become officially yours, GetVik applies the platform fee.  
Nothing hidden — you see it clearly per order.

You always know:

- What the buyer paid  
- What fee was taken  
- What you earned  

Transparency is the default.

## The real part — fast, predictable payouts

GetVik gives you control over your earnings with a simple payout system.

Here's how it works:

- Minimum payout amount: **₹100**  
- Processing time: **5-7 days** after you request withdrawal  
- Withdraw to your bank account or UPI ID  

You can request a payout anytime once your balance crosses ₹100.  
It's predictable, clean, and designed for Indian creators.

## And then… your payout arrives

Just click "Request payout" button.  
Minimum balance is ₹100. 

If your bank details are verified,  
**your payout is processed within 5-7 days and lands directly in your account.**

Every. Single. Time.

## Why this matters

Creators hate messy payout systems.  
If money doesn’t arrive on time, trust disappears instantly.

GetVik keeps things:

- Predictable  
- Consistent  
- Transparent  
- Creator-friendly  

You always know when your money is coming.

## The whole thing in one line

**Sell anytime → request payout (₹100 min) → receive in 5-7 days.**  
Zero drama. Zero confusion. Just how payouts should be.
