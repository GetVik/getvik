## When someone buys your product…

The moment a buyer completes payment — UPI or card — everything fires instantly:

- The order is created  
- Your earnings balance updates  
- Your digital file is delivered  

No loading bars. No “awaiting approval.”  
Just instant movement.

---

## The platform fee part (don’t worry, it’s simple)

Before the earnings become officially yours, GetVik applies the platform fee.  
Nothing hidden — you see it clearly per order.

You always know:

- What the buyer paid  
- What fee was taken  
- What you earned  

Transparency is the default.

## The real part — the rolling 15-day settlement window

GetVik uses a standard **15-day settlement cycle**.

Here’s the easiest way to think about it:

- A sale today → becomes eligible in 15 days  
- A sale tomorrow → becomes eligible 15 days from tomorrow  

Every sale has its own countdown timer.  
It’s predictable, clean, and aligned with banking norms.

## And then… your payout just happens

Just click "Request payout" button.  
Minimum balance is ₹500. 

If your bank details are verified and the settlement date arrives,  
**your payout goes straight to your bank account automatically.**

Every. Single. Time.

## Why this matters

Creators hate messy payout systems.  
If money doesn’t arrive on time, trust disappears instantly.

GetVik keeps things:

- Predictable  
- Consistent  
- Transparent  
- Fully automated  

You always know when your money is coming.

## The whole thing in one line

**Sell anytime → wait 15 days → money lands in your bank.**  
Zero drama. Zero confusion. Just how payouts should be.
