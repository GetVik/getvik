## Guidelines
- **Strictly Mock-Only**: PRs must not add real API keys, provider scripts, or backend connections.
- **Demo Toggle**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO=true` if you need to gate specific demo features.
- **Design System**: Use the existing Tailwind CSS design system.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure all new components are responsive and accessible.

## Good First Issues
Look for issues labeled `good first issue` to get started. We love small UI polishes and accessibility improvements!
