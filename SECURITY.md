# Security Policy

This is a mock application for demonstration purposes.

**Please do not report security issues related to:**
- Mock data exposure (e.g., `data/mock.ts`).
- Hardcoded mock credentials (`demo@getvik.com`).
- Lack of real backend validation (since there is no backend).
- CSP allowing `unsafe-inline` (required for some demo components).

For real vulnerabilities in the frontend code or dependencies, please contact: contact.getvik@gmail.com
